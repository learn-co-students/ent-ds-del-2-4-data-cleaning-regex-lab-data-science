    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the last lesson, we introduced a lot of new concepts. We introduced Regular Expressions, and showed how to use them to replace or retrieve information - from a DataFrame, a string or a file. In this lab, we're going to get some practice - first by writing regular expresssions to clean up strings, and then to apply transformations to information in a DataFrame and then finally to pull strings from a larger document. \n",
